This library is a collection of routines for configuring the 16 bit hardware timer called Timer1 on the ATmega168/328. There are 3 hardware timers available on the chip, and they can be configured in a variety of ways to achieve different functionality. The development of this library began with the need for a way to quickly and easily set the PWM period or frequency, but has grown to include timer overflow interrupt handling and other features.

* A separately maintained and updated copy of TimerOne is also available, supporting more hardware and with optimizations for more efficient code: https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/TimerOne
