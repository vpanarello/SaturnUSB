### Description

* This is a microcontroller applications designed to run inside Arduino Leonardo or compatible boards. This sketch turns your Arduino into a Sega Saturn Controllers interpreter that can be recognised as a USB device in Windows. In other words, you can use your old Sega Saturn or Genesis controllers in your PC to play any game or your favorites old titles through an video game emulator.

st
==

simple statistics from the command line interface (CLI)

### Description

Imagine you have this sample file:

    $ cat numbers.txt
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9
    10

How do you calculate the sum of the numbers?

#### The traditional way

If you ask around, you'll come up with suggestions like these:

    $ awk '{s+=$1} END {print s}' numbers.txt
    55

    $ perl -lne '$x += $_; END { print $x; }' numbers.txt
    55

    $ sum=0; while read num ; do sum=$(($sum + $num)); done < numbers.txt ; echo $sum
    55

    $ paste -sd+ numbers.txt | bc
    55

Now imagine that you need to calculate the arithmetic mean, median,
or standard deviation...


#### Using st

"st" is a command-line tool to calculate simple statistics from a
file or standard input.

Let's start with "sum":

    $ st --sum numbers.txt
    55

That was easy!

How about mean and standard deviation?

    $ st --mean --stddev numbers.txt
    mean  stddev
    5.5   3.02765

If you don't specify any options, you'll get this output:

    $ st numbers.txt
    N     min   max   sum   mean  stddev
    10    1     10    55    5.5   3.02765

You can switch rows and columns using the "--transpose-output" option:

    $ st --transpose-output numbers.txt
    N       10
    min     1
    max     10
    sum     55
    mean    5.5
    stddev  3.02765

The "--summary" option will provide the five-number summary:

    $ st --summary numbers.txt
    min   q1    median  q3    max
    1     3.5   5.5     7.5   10

And "--complete" will print a complete description:

    $ st --complete numbers.txt
    N   min   q1    median  q3    max   sum   mean  stddev  stderr
    10  1     3.5   5.5     7.5   10    55    5.5   3.02765 0.957427

#### How does it compare with R, Octave and other analytical tools?

"R" and Octave are integrated suites for data manipulation, calculation
and graphical display.

They provide high-level interpreted languages, capabilities for the
numerical solution of linear and nonlinear problems, and for
performing other numerical experiments, including statistical tests,
classification, clustering, etc.

"st" is a simpler solution for simpler problems, focused on descriptive
statistics for small datasets, handy when you need quick results
without leaving the shell.


### Usage

    st [options] [file]

#### Options

##### Functions

    --N|n|count
    --mean|avg|m
    --stddev|sd
    --stderr|sem|se
    --sum|s
    --var|variance

    --min
    --q1
    --median
    --q3
    --max

If no functions are selected, "st" will print the default output:

    N     min  max  sum  mean  stddev

You can also use the following predefined sets of functions:

    --summary   # five-number summary (min q1 median q3 max)
    --complete  # everything

##### Formatting

    --format|fmt|f=<value>  # default: "%g"
    --delimiter|d=<value>   # default: "\t"

    --no-header|nh          # don't display header
    --transpose-output|to   # switch rows and columns

Examples of valid formats ("--format" option):

        %d    signed integer, in decimal
        %e    floating-point number, in scientific notation
        %f    floating-point number, in fixed decimal notation
        %g    floating-point number, in %e or %f notation

##### Input validation

By default, "st" skips invalid input with a warning.

You can change this behavior with the following options:

    --strict   # throws an error, interrupting process
    --quiet|q  # no warning
